This application demonstrates how to use the Harvest Chosen library
with Rails. The standard Harvest Chosen library provide a drop-in
jQuery replacement for the standard html SELECT menu.

This demo uses the Koenpunt fork of Chosen, which allows new options
to be entered in the select menu.

You can see the demo in action here:
